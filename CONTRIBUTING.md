# Contributing

Please feel free to submit pull requests for any issues, improvements or bug fixes. I will aim to review them as soon as possible, probably within 24 hours.
Consult with me if you need to add or update any dependencies.

## Standards
- Please use standard jsdoc for all pull requests, and comment and space your blocks of code appropriately.
- Spaces instead of tabs for indentation
